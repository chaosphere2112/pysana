A Python implementation of an API client for Asana.

This is mostly to test out some idea I have for a "nice" way to write a client library. It uses some access patterns
that need some work; it's kind of slow as is, even for simple requests. At this point it's mostly just a brain dump of
the ideas I've had for constructing a lazy-loaded API client in very idiomatic python style.
